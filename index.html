	      <br><br>

        <p>From a very young age I have always been interested in knowledge and learning new things. </p>
        <p>However, since I finished high school I was not sure what I wanted to do, who I wanted to be, so, I decided to try medicine and after a while I did not end up liking the career. So I had several conversations with my mother, family and friends, I started to think and remembered what I liked most as a child, which were computers. I was the typical kid who took apart technological devices to see how they worked and then looked in books for ways to repair them.</p>
        <p>In the town where I lived I did not have much contact with the technological world, or sometimes the things that were already in the capital had not yet reached where I lived. Computers were not something so common in my life, until my parents brought the family's first personal computer.</p>
        <p>So I decided to try the world of computing, starting with that desktop PC that was used in my house, and that's when I started using it and "correcting" the many errors it had. I decided that I wanted to dedicate myself to the world of computing.</p>
        <p>Thanks to that inspiration I started the computer science career and I realized that it was what I really liked. However, things did not turn out as they should. I am Venezuelan, my country was going through a bad time and together with my family I had to make one of the most important decisions of my life: go to a new country and look for new and better opportunities. So I had to stop the career that I liked so much, but I continued learning virtually through tutorials and blogs that helped me understand many things about the world of programming and computing.</p>
        <p>After a while, thanks to the opportunities I was given while here, I was able to start a technical labor in systems. After many ups and downs came the moment for which I had prepared; the fact that I finished the technical work, which was the first step of my learning path and, in addition, to work with computers as a purpose of life.</p>
        <p>The fact that I started learning languages such as English and Portuguese helped create a good start for what I know for sure, which is what I want to dedicate myself to now and one of many achievements I want to achieve.</p>
